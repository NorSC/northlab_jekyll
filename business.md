## Business and Engagement

We work with a number of partner organisations and clients including SMEs, Fortune 500 companies, local and central Government and third sector organisations and charities. This includes Philips, Santander, Home Group plc, Microsoft Research, the National Trust, Newcastle City Council and many others (take a look through our projects page for more examples).

We provide a number of commercial and bespoke research services including strategic design consulting, user experience (UX) design and research, and interactive technology development.

We are currently running a new business engagement service the [Digital Disruption Network](http://www.digitaldisruption.org.uk/), which provides a low risk forum for businesses to explore new disruptive technologies in their industry.

For business enquiries please contact our Client Relationship Manager [Charlie MacDowall](mailto:charlie.macdowall@northumbria.ac.uk). For enquiries about the Digital Disruption Network please contact [Prof. Lars Erik Holmquist](mailto:lars.holmquist@northumbria.ac.uk)
