Bio: I am a PhD Student at Northumbria Social Computing Lab (NorSC). My research is at the intersection of digital work and wellbeing. I study freelancers working practices and experiences using gig economy platforms. I also explore ways of supporting various aspects of their wellbeing. I am interested in investigating online co-design methods and digital interventions.

Before my PhD studies, I worked at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent, where I designed global digital engagements, serious games, simulations, and communication campaigns. In my spare time, I play board games, spend time outdoors and read fantasy novels.
