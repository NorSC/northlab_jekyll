Senior Lecturer. Dr Perla Innocenti is a digital cultural heritage scholar with a passion for curating, making accessible and sustainably reusing tangible and intangible heritage.

Dr Innocenti was invited to join the team of the iSchool of Northumbria University in 2015. Her research and several publications cross interdisciplinary boundaries between cultural heritage, museum studies, cultural informatics, library and information science. Her recently published volume with Routledge is CulturalNetworks in Migrating Heritage: Intersecting Theories and Practices across Europe. She recently became Equality and Diversity Lead for the Computer and Information Science Department.

As a Research Fellow at University of Glasgow, she led interdisciplinary research on cultural networks as Principal Investigator in the EU-funded FP7 SSH collaborative research project MeLA-Museums in an Age of Migrations and contributed as invited expert to the Network for Digital Methods in the Arts and Humanities (NeDiMAH), funded by the European Science Foundation. Prior to this, in Glasgow she was Co-Investigator of the EU CIP-ICT collaborative PSP project ECLAP-European Collected Library of Artistis Performances; Co-Investigator and team-leader of the EU FP7-ICT collaborative R&amp;D projects SHAMAN (Sustaining Heritage Accessthrough Multivalent Archiving) and DL.org (Coordination Action on Digital Library Interoperability, Best Practices, and Modelling Foundations). She also contributed to three EU FP6-ICT projects on digital preservation, developing repository design and audit research of the DRAMBOR AInteractive Toolkit (DPE-DigitalPreservationEurope in collaboration with UK Digital Curation Center), usage models research in digital preservation (Planets- Preservation and Long-term Access through Networked Services) and certification and trusted repositories (CASPAR-Cultural, Artistic and Scientific knowledge for Preservation, Access and Retrieval).

Dr Innocenti was invited to join the team in Glasgow while working at the Politecnico di Milano, Italy, where she held a research scholarship on information systems for industrial design and coordinated digital libraries’ activities and projects. Prior to that, she conducted research on museology and museography in Italy with Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Goppion Laboratorio Museotecnico, Istituto Nazionale di Archeologia e Storia dell’Arte in Rome, and Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna.
