I have a background in art, graphic and interaction design. I developed my craft-based practice at the London College of Communication before graduating from the Royal College of Art where I became interested in inclusive and participatory design. Since then, I have conducted participatory research with diverse groups where I used my expertise to design tools for co-creation. In my PhD, I explored the potential of craft and interactive technology for museums, and engaged the local community in the process of co-creating multisensory and digitally-augmented experiences of heritage. Alongside my research, I have been teaching workshops and design-led courses at the RCA, LCC and Sheffield Hallam University. I have also been developing exhibition and interactive design for cultural institutions such as the National Trust, English Heritage, Historic Royal Palaces. In 2015, I was awarded with “Ones to Watch, Rethinking Reality” by the Design Council and has also received funding such as grants from the Arts Council England to support my public engagement and exhibition work.<br>
