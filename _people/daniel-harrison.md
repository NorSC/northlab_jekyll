I am a Vice-Chancellor’s Research Fellow in CoCreate, in the School of Design. My research lies in the area of digital health and wellbeing and personal informatics. I’m interested in how digital technologies can support people in managing their health and reach their wellness goals, being mindful of potentially negative consequences. I have a cross-disciplinary background and research interests in human-computer interaction, behaviour change, health informatics, personal tracking and the application of AI, with experience in design and clinical settings. I have been described as a designer, computer scientist, social scientist and ethnographic researcher. I enjoy undertaking and analysing qualitative, ethnographic research, as well as prototyping and evaluating digital systems. I completed my PhD, entitled “The Self-Tracker’s Journey: situated engagement and non-engagement with personal informatics systems over time” at the UCL Interaction Centre (UCLIC), and I have previously worked in The Georgia Institute of Technology and Microsoft Research Cambridge.
