I am a doctoral researcher based on the School of Design at Northumbria University, working on an AHRC funded National Productivity Investment Fund studentship. After more than a decade working in the user experience industry, I started a PhD in October 2017 working with John Vines, Lars Erik Holmquist, and Rachel Clarke (all at Northumbria) and Dorothy Liviabella from the Vulnerable Customers team at Santander UK. My research aims to explore new possibilities for digital money through participatory design with older adults.
