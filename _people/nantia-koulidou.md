I am a design researcher with a background in architecture, jewellery and participatory design. My ways of working are rooted in craft practice and dialogue with participants. I recently awarded my PhD for my thesis ³A practice-led inquiry into the nature of digital jewellery² from Northumbria University where I was investigating the potential role of digital jewellery to support self in transition. For this research, I reflected on my own experience of travelling between the UK and Greece and I worked with others to design digital jewellery that suggest more poetic and imaginative aspects of digital technology.

Currently, I am a Research Associate in Design at Northumbria University, on the Enabling Ongoingness project, where we explore new ways in which digital media and digital services could enable dynamic connections between people even after death.
