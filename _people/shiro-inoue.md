I have engaged in a number of design research activities and professional design practices in several countries (Japan, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark), focusing on the perceptive interaction between humans and artefacts. My PhD investigated the industrial designer’s cognitive activities within the processes of idea generation, focusing on how reduced and incomplete information provides stimuli and can beneficially impact upon the designers’ creative reasoning. I have been working in CoCreate on a project on the design of new services and systems to help people understand and manage experiences of fatigue.
