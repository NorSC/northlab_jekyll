I am a doctoral researcher working in the School of Design at Northumbria, based in CoCreate. My PhD research is focused on design for dementia, working in residential care homes in the North East. Iâ€™m a product designer and I work primarily with physical materials. My work focuses on promoting self-expression and autonomy through the designed environment.
