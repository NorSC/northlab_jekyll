Prof. Mark Blythe is a design ethnographer working in the field of Human Computer Interaction. His research is concerned with the digital revolution we are stumbling and tumbling through and how this changes the ways we live, work, make art and grow old. He likes to write about himself in the third person, like Caesar.
