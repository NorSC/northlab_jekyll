I am currently a PhD Student on Human-Computer Interaction for Digital Living. I am interested in interaction with distributed data in (everyday) environments that supports or relieves human cognition. I am specialised in Research through Design and received my Masterâ€™s degree with distinction at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with software, hardware and woodworking, cycling and playing board games with friends or family.
