I am a design-researcher, and since 2014 I have worked at Northumbria University as a Graduate Tutor, combining doctoral study with teaching on our Graphic Design BA (hons). My background is in graphic and communication design. I have worked in the publishing industry and as a freelance designer working across graphic and interaction design with clients such as Dr Martins, Durham University and the Young Women’s Music Project, Oxford. My PhD research uses feminist STS to frame and develop an understanding of critical and speculative design research as a means of ‘staying with the trouble’. It is based upon two interrelated projects – a designer-led inquiry into network technology and public space, and an interdisciplinary research project exploring responses to hate crime with LGBT young people.
