I am an artist and designer conducting a PhD study into the political economy of social innovation, with an emphasis on grass roots activism and the emerging digital economy. I am lucky enough to have had a diverse experience of industrial, communication, transport and service design. I have ran a design consultancy since 2012, built the UKâ€™s first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, and have been involved in numerous political and community activist projects. In 2017 I was awarded the Foulis award by the Glasgow School of Art for design research into global civics. I am currently researching a crowdfunding campaign to develop a community bakery, and a community action research project on a rural Scottish Island, using design fiction to evoke responses to long term challenges.
