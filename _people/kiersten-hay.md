I am an interdisciplinary designer and PhD student, currently working with women living with HIV in the UK to explore identity and use of digital technologies. My research interests focus on new ways to both research and express information normally restricted by social constructions of communication and expression. This has included work on topics including personal identity, online informational privacy, visual communication design, cultural heritage, interactive narratives, feminism, and stigma. I completed my Bachelor of Design in Fashion Communications at Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada, and my Master of Arts in Design Informatics at the Edinburgh College of Art in Edinburgh, UK.
