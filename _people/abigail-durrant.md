I am an interaction designer and researcher predominantly working in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I teach Interaction Design at Northumbria.

My research addresses the significant design challenges that we face for managing identity in our everyday interactions with digital technologies and personal data. I have explored the digital representation of selfhood in the context of family relationships and legacies, major life transitions, memorialization, cultural heritage, human rights media, and personal identity management. I am particularly interested in the health implications of managing a digitally-mediated self.<br>
I am Principal Investigator for the EPSRC-funded project ‘INTUIT: Interaction Design for Trusted Sharing of Personal Health Data to Live Well with HIV’ (EP/R033900/1), a design-led programme that aims to understand and address issues of trust, identity and privacy that are experienced by people living with HIV when sharing self-generated data with clinicians, peers, and others, for the purposes of self-managing their condition. I’m also Co-I on EPSRC Playing Out with IOT (EP/P025544/2), exploring an outdoor design space for children’s creative free play with Internet of Things. My work is grounded in cocreative, experience-centered, and research-through-design approaches, working closely with non-academic partners to define and conduct research.

More details on my background, current projects, teaching, and services to academic communities can be found on my personal website and Northumbria staff page.
