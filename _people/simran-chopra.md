I am a doctoral candidate in the department of Computer &amp; Information Science. I started my PhD in 2017, after a disciplinary background in Design and industrial experience in Graphic, and UX Design. Currently, I am working on a transdisciplinary approach to sustainable HCI research and HCI for alternative food systems with Adrian Clear, Dave Kirk and Rachel Clarke. The work focuses on practices of “futuring” in grassroots communities and how HCI can facilitate openness, participation, and coordination in constructing visions of the future, and in reconciling these with the everyday practices of the communities. I am supported by Northumbria University RDF studentship.
