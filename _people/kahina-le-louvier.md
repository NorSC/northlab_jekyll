Bio: I am a social researcher interested in migration and asylum. My PhD investigated the information experience of people going through the UK asylum system. I am currently working as a Senior Research Assistant on the EU funded H2020 multi-partner PERCEPTIONS project, which investigates the (mis-)perceptions of the EU held outside of Europe.

Department: Computer and Information Science
