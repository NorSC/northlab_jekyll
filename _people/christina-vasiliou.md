Lecturer. Christinaâ€™s research focuses on human computer interaction, computer-supported collaborative learning and cooperative work, development and evaluation of shared workspaces, design of interactive technologies and spaces for new experiences, participatory and user-centred design approaches.

She previously worked as a post-doctoral researcher at Newcastle University, incorporating digital technologies into the design, production and post-production activities associated with theatrical productions (in collaboration with Northern Stage).

She holds a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction (Cyprus University of Technology), a MSc in Human-Centred Interactive Technologies (University of York, UK) and a BSc in Computer Science (University of Cyprus). In her doctoral work, she focused on understanding the complex interactions and interdependencies in a mutli-device ecology from a distributed cognition perspective and produced a number of design implications for interaction and instructional designers. At the same time, she also worked as a research associate and developer at the Cyprus Interaction Lab for various projects such as, WomenPower (online platform for women mentor and mentees), and InfoSpaces (building exemplars for creative multimodal information spaces for problem-based learning).
