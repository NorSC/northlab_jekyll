I am an Applied Computer Scientist with an interest in the Built Environment. Gaining a BSc in Applied Computing at Northumbria in 2001 I started a research role at Newcastle University developing technology solutions for the construction industry. After this I worked in industry as a software engineer for a number of companies including NBS and TH_NK. I returned to Northumbria&nbsp; in 2009 completing a PhD in virtual training systems for gas safety. Since then I have had various academic roles at Northumbria including a Vice Chancellorâ€™s Research Fellowship in Digital Living.

I am a researcher at the BIM Academy where my role involves developing industry collaborative research with organisations such as HS2, Costain, Your Homes Newcastle and Buildstream. I am also an academic at the International Centre for Connected Construction again with responsibility for developing industry collaborative partnerships and projects. My main areas of research include Smart Connected Technologies in the Built Environment, including IoT, Building Information Modelling, Interoperability, Data Visualisation and Data Science. I lecture in software design and development, cloud computing and API technologies. I have a number of peer reviewed publications, a book chapter and research awards from EPSRC, AHRC, Innovate UK and Horizon 2020.
