Iâ€™m a doctoral research with a background in design led innovation and social sciences. I bring a critical thinking perspective to projects and am interested in the strategic use of design to think about socially responsible innovations using digital technologies. My doctoral research focuses on exploring the use of emerging technologies and artificial intelligent in creative and digital design studios.
