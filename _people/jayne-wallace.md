Bio: My work explores the potential of design and digital technologies, jewellery and the act of making to support sense of self across a range of complex human contexts.&nbsp;I’m co-founder and co-editor of the&nbsp;<a title="Original URL: https://www.journalofjewelleryresearch.org/ Click to follow link." href="https://www.journalofjewelleryresearch.org/">Journal of Jewellery Research</a>&nbsp;with Dr Roberta Bernabei and co-founder of the&nbsp;<a title="Original URL: https://www.researchthroughdesign.org/ Click to follow link." href="https://www.researchthroughdesign.org/">Research Through Design</a>&nbsp;conference series with Prof Joyce Yee.

At Northumbria, I am based in the School of Design’s&nbsp;<a href="https://cocreatenorthumbria.org/">CoCreate</a>&nbsp;group, where I work with a brilliant group of academics, post-doctoral and doctoral researchers all exploring the intersection of design, technology and participation in a range of human contexts.
