Having completed BSc in Industrial Design at Istanbul Technical University (Turkey), and MSc in Interaction Design at Malmö University (Sweden), I’ve recently joined “Understanding Fatigue in Healthcare” project at Northumbria University (UK) as part of my PhD studies. My research interests are around and in-between the notions of cyborg, embodiment, power, and epistemology. My PhD is exploring some of these ideas through exploring how knowledge is generated in research through design projects. I can be found contemplating, storytelling, reading (mostly non-fiction), cooking, or walking around aimlessly if not juggling with ideas.
