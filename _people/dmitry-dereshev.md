I am&nbsp;interested in peopleâ€™s daily lives with socially enabled technologies&nbsp;like smart speakers&nbsp;(<a title="https://www.amazon.com/b/?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9818047011" href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9818047011">Amazon Echo</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_home">Google Home</a>) and companion robots (<a href="https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/robots/pepper">Pepper</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bluefrogrobotics.com/en/buddy/">Buddy</a>). I strive to identify long-term values that current domestic technology holds, and how those could be pragmatically implemented into the upcoming social robots.
