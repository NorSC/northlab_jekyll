**Nor**thumbria **T**echnology for **H**umanity (**NORTH**) Lab is a highly interdisciplinary Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), User Experience (UX) and Interaction Design (IxD) community based at Northumbria University. We are one of the largest groupings of HCI researchers in the UK, bringing together a collective of researchers with backgrounds and expertise in Design, Psychology, Computer Science and Business.<br /><br />

**NORTH Lab** provides a focal point for HCI research across Northumbria University, sharing an extensive range of research facilities and supporting a ‘think tank’ environment for critical inquiry at the intersections of people, place and interactive digital and other emerging technologies. We meet as a community twice a month for lab talks from our own researchers and from visitors. We also provide commercial research services for industry (please see the 'Business' link above for contact details).<br /><br />

We have particular strengths in participatory and co-design techniques for technology development, social computing, cybersecurity, digital identity management, sustainability, urban informatics, speculative and critical design approaches and UX design/consulting/research. To understand better what we do, check out our project pages.
