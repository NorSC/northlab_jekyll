<h3>Upcoming Talks</h3>
<p><strong>24th June &#8211; 25th June 2021</strong> (2pm-4pm UK time, Online Conference via Zoom)</p>
<h4>PGR Summer Conference 2021</h4>
<p>This is the first year that NORTH Lab is running a student led PGR summer conference to showcase the incredible work from our PGR community. The event is taking place across two afternoons (Thursday 24th June and Friday 25th June) in the summer of 2021. This page highlights the work being presented at the event, and the organisers who have spent time putting this together for the NORTHLab community. To open the event, Professor Lynne Coventry will be speaking, together with one of our event organisers, Megan Doherty. Friday afternoon will be hosted by another of our event organisers, Leila Hogarth. We hope this will be the first of a regular annual student led event that will allow our community to shine a spotlight on the incredible work being undertaken by our PGR’s, and that the event provides an opportunity for us all to share insights and feedback.</p>

<p><strong>19th May 2021</strong> (12-1pm UK time, Online Seminar via Zoom)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Book Launch &#8211; Digitally Augmenting Traditional Craft Practices for Social Justice: The Partnership Quilt</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Dr Angelika Strohmayer</strong> (Northumbria University) and <strong>Laura McIntrye</strong> (Changing Lives)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This book weaves together disparate worlds of crafting, social justice, and digital technologies around The Partnership Quilt. It crafts a manifesto for meaningful action and design processes in charitable organizations through participatory sewing and its digital augmentation. The book charts a history of how sewing has been used to voice concerns of oppression, and how digital technologies can be embedded into textiles to tell stories more powerfully. It explores the relationship between quilting and research, looking beyond the seams of The Partnership Quilt to shed light on the importance of invisible work behind such participatory, justice-oriented design projects. It concludes with a discussion of the impacts and potential future avenues for research on digitally quilting social justice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This book launch will mark the occasion of the publication of Dr Angelika Strohmayer’s first book, published by Palgrave Macmillan. In the session, you will hear about two perspectives of the book: one from the author and the other from a manager at the organisation with him she collaborated on the project described and analysed within it. There will be two short talks in the session before the floor is opened for questions and discussion. First, Strohmayer will present an overview of the theories and practices used in the book, highlighting the academic contributions. Second, McIntyre will present a reflection of the practical impacts this project has had on Changing Lives &#8211; the ways in which it has shaper her own understanding of service delivery as well as how it impacted on service delivery and development more widely.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Dr Angelika Strohmayer</strong> is a lecturer and co-director of the newly established Design Feminisms Research Group at Northumbria University’s School of Design. Her collaborative in-the-world work sits at the intersection of technologies, craft, social justice, and feminisms &#8211; contributing to theoretical conversations through applied research methods. She is dedicated to the inclusion of under- and mis-represented people in research, design, and academia, and proactively works towards equity, diversity, and inclusion. Some of this is shown through her work as a founding member of fempower.tech, an international technology research collective, and her co-editing of the ‘Meaningful Design Processes’ Forum in the ACM Interactions Magazine. In all that she does, Angelika tries to work across boundaries, bringing together disparate groups to engage in endeavours that support personal wellbeing, counteracting community traumas, and engaging in public advocacy to move towards more socially just worlds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Laura McIntyre</strong> is a leader in the voluntary sector, in her role as Head of Services for Women and Children for Changing Lives, a national charity with roots in the North East. Laura has set up and developed a range of innovative services for women across the North and Midlands, including developing peer research methodology which have contributed to policy recommendations and policy change at a local and national level. She has set up women’s centres, both building-based and virtually, and has developed trauma responsive models of care for Changing Lives. Laura is a Winston Churchill Fellow of 2011, and has specialist expertise supporting women who sell and exchange sex, and women who are targeted and groomed for sexual exploitation.</p>

<h3>Talks from 2020/2021 Academic Year</h3>
<p><strong>28th April 2021</strong> (12-2pm UK time, Online Seminar via Zoom)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>CHI 2021 Preview Talks</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Chair:</em> <strong>Dr Joe Newbold</strong> (Northumbria University)</p>
<p><strong>21st April 2021</strong> (12-1pm UK time, Online Seminar via Zoom)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Work in progress talks</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Carlos Alvarez</strong> (Northumbria University) <strong>Derianna Thomas</strong> (Northumbria University) <strong>Jens Alexander</strong> (Northumbria University)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Carlos Alvarez</strong> is a PhD student at the Department of Computer and Information Sciences. His supervisors are Marta Cecchinato and John Rooksby. In this talk, Carlos will present his ongoing study, harnessing a qualitative diary to explore online freelancers&#8217; work-life boundaries. For an overview of this research, visit https://freelbalance.info. You can find more about Carlos&#8217; work at https://carlosalvarez.org</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Derianna Thomas</strong> is a 2nd year PhD Student in CoCreate, supervised by Lars Erik Holmquist and Shaun Lawson. She will be presenting results from her latest paper on everyday user opinions of augmented reality devices, and how she plans to build on these results with focus groups that look into the everyday objects we use when working from home.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Jens Alexander</strong> is one of five fellows of the Open Design of Trusted Things (OpenDoTT) project at the School of Art and Design.

<p><strong>16th December 2020</strong> (12-1pm UK time, Online Seminar via Zoom)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Understanding Inclusive Privacy and Security</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Panellists:</em> <strong>Dr Angelika Strohmayer</strong> (Northumbria University), <strong>Professor Lizzie Coles Kemp</strong> (Royal Holloway, University of London) and <strong>Dr Ada Lerner</strong> (Wellesley College).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Chair:</em> <strong>Professor Lynne Coventry</strong> (Northumbria University)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Security and privacy challenges confront all participants in modern society, but particular groups may experience unique or uneven privacy and security concerns. These groups may face distinctive obstacles to addressing issues, and their particular needs and concerns may not be well understood beyond those groups. Traditionally, inclusive design has addressed physical accessibility as well as needs arising from age, disability, or environment. While this work remains critical, our community also increasingly recognizes the importance of accounting for the needs of vulnerable users or marginalized groups. We deliberately avoid any concrete definitions of what &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; means in this context. We encourage a diverse discussion of any group or situation that could be deemed as vulnerable, without prejudice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In this panel, we explore the privacy and security experiences and needs of vulnerable user groups. We are interested in populations or roles in our society (e.g., lawyers, journalists, politicians, activists, medical providers) that support vulnerable individuals or whose role creates their own vulnerability. We will discuss ways of taking a more inclusive approach to appreciating, identifying and addressing privacy and security challenges. In the process we may also  identify unintended harms resulting from privacy and security technology.</p>
<p><strong>25th November 2020</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>The Design Studio (and workplace) of the Future</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Lars Erik Holmquist</strong>, School of Design, Northumbria University</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The pandemic has drastically changed how creative practices such as design – or research for that matter – carry out their work. Gone (for now) is the large, thriving design studio where dozens or hundreds of people share space, ideas, and inspiration. Gone is also the frequent informal encounters in coffee rooms and corridors, and the “happy accidents” that come out of sharing a space with someone who has a completely different perspective. While some of this may return, we have also learned other ways to work remotely that have their own advantages. How will we live and work creatively in the future, in “blended” spaces, preserving the best aspects of physical co-location while also taking advantage of new (and old!) virtual and distance working technologies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This will be a creative group discussion, open for all. I will start with a short presentation of some ideas, and then leave the floor for sharing ideas. Perhaps we can invent some new ways of working and teaching in the space of 45 minutes on Zoom!</p>
<p><strong>11th November 2020</strong> (12-1pm UK time, Online Seminar via Zoom)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Online Panel on &#8216;<i>Critical Perspectives on Health and Technology&#8217;</i></strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Claire</b> <b>McCallum</b><b>,</b> Dept. Social Work, Education &amp; Community Wellbeing, Northumbria University</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Kiersten Hay</b><b>,</b> CoCreate, School of Design, Northumbria University</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Danny Harrison</b><b>,</b> CoCreate, School of Design, Northumbria University</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>John </b><b>Rooksby</b><b>,</b> NorSC, Dept. Computer &amp; Information Science, Northumbria University</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Rob Wilson</b><b>,</b> Living Lab, Newcastle Business School, Northumbria University</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In this NORTH Lab online session, we will host a panel formed of five colleagues from across Northumbria University who will briefly present about their work in relation to the broad topic of critical perspectives on health and technology. There will be plenty of time at the end of the session to discuss threads and links between the panels work, and to discuss ideas and ask questions to the panelists.</p>
<p><strong>14th October 2020</strong> (12-1pm UK time, Online Seminar via Zoom)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Online narratives of migrants and migration to the EU</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kahina Le Louvier, Jamie Mahoney, Tanya Vlasova</strong> and <strong>Shaun Lawson</strong> (NorSC, Northumbria University)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The aims of the EU funded H2020 PERCEPTIONS project are to: identify narratives, images and perceptions of Europe abroad; investigate how different narratives could lead to problems, unrealistic expectations, security threats or even radicalisation; and create toolkits of creative and innovative measures to react or even counteract these, considering social, societal and structural aspects. NorSC are a key partner in the consortium and we lead the project&#8217;s activity in Identifying what perceptions of Europe are held by (potential) migrants and how these are reflected in social and mainstream media. At this NORTH Lab session, we will give an update on the project and its activities.</p>
<h3>Talks from 2019/2020 Academic Year</h3>
<p><strong>5th August</strong> (12-1pm, Online Seminar via Zoom)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Panel session with 3 guest speakers from the committee of the British Psychological Society Cyberpsychology Section:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Host: <strong>Dawn Branley-Bell</strong> (PaCTLab)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Linda Kaye</strong>: Exploring Gamer Identity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dr Linda K. Kaye is a Chartered Psychologist and chair of the BPS Cyberpsychology Section. Linda is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychology at Edge Hill University and specialises in areas relating to cyberpsychology and explores ways in which online settings can promote social inclusion and well-being. Linda will be joining us to talk about Exploring Gamer Identity: Social identity theory (SIT) has been widely applied to many contexts as a way of understanding group identity and the associated impacts. However, less research has explored the relevance of SIT to digital gaming. This talk briefly outlines recent studies which have sought to establish a number of psychosocial outcomes associated with gaming identity across a number of gaming domains. From this, it will illuminate the benefits of building gamer identity and how objective behaviours such as language use and network maps may be utilised to more fully explore this within situated contexts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Graham Scott</strong>: Victim Blame in Cyberbullying</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dr Graham Scott is a Lecturer in the School of Media, Culture and Society at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) and treasurer for the BPS Cyberpsychology Section. Graham has a keen interest in online impression formation and he will be joining us to discuss Victim Blame in Cyberbullying.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Chris Fullwood</strong>: Do avatar characteristics alter our behaviour? Exploring in-game and real life effects in Autistic and neurotypical participants</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dr Chris Fullwood is a reader in Cyberpsychology in the Psychology Department at the University of Wolverhampton, chartered member of the BPS and coordinator of the CRUW Cyberpsychology Research Cluster. He is a founding member of the BPS Cyberpsychology section and current liaison to the BPS Research Board. His research interests chiefly focus on online impression management and he sits on the editorial board for the journal Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking. He has published extensively in the field, edited numerous textbooks, chaired international conferences and helped to develop a masters in Cyberpsychology.
