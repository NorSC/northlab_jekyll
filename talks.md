## Talks

We maintain a regular set of talks (at least twice a month, often weekly) to bring the members of NORTH Lab community together. Talks are a mix of internal speakers and external guest speakers. Everyone is welcome to attend these (within the University and beyond).

We are currently running the NORTH Lab talk series as online sessions via Zoom. The talks will be run at our usual regular day and time (Wednesdays, 12-1pm UK time).
