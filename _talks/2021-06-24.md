This is the first year that NORTH Lab is running a student led PGR summer conference to showcase the incredible work from our PGR community. The event is taking place across two afternoons (Thursday 24th June and Friday 25th June) in the summer of 2021. This page highlights the work being presented at the event, and the organisers who have spent time putting this together for the NORTHLab community. To open the event, Professor Lynne Coventry will be speaking, together with one of our event organisers, Megan Doherty. Friday afternoon will be hosted by another of our event organisers, Leila Hogarth. We hope this will be the first of a regular annual student led event that will allow our community to shine a spotlight on the incredible work being undertaken by our PGR’s, and that the event provides an opportunity for us all to share insights and feedback.
